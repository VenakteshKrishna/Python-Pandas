Python OOPS
ðŸ§  What is OOP in Python? Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach based on objects. Objects are real-world entities like a car, person, or account, which have attributes (data) and methods (functions).

In Python, OOP helps to organize code in a modular, reusable, and structured way.

ðŸ”‘ Four Pillars of OOP in Python

Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of an object and restricting direct access to them. Instead, you use methods to interact with the object. This improves security and protects the data.

Abstraction
Abstraction means hiding complex logic and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity by focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.

Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (called the child or derived class) to reuse the features of another class (called the parent or base class). It promotes code reusability and makes it easier to manage and extend code.

Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one name, many forms. It allows different classes to define the same method name in different ways. The method will behave differently depending on the object that calls it.

ðŸ§± Important OOP Terms ðŸ“Œ Class A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines what data and functions an object should have.

ðŸ“Œ Object An object is a real instance of a class. It has its own values for the attributes defined in the class.

ðŸ“Œ Constructor (init) A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object with specific values.

ðŸ“Œ self Keyword self refers to the current object inside the class. It is used to access attributes and methods of the object.

ðŸ“Ž Types of Methods in Python Classes Instance Methods: Work with instance variables and require self as the first parameter.

Class Methods: Work with class variables and use @classmethod decorator. They take cls as the first parameter.

Static Methods: Do not access instance or class variables. Use @staticmethod and have no default parameters.

ðŸŽ¯ Summary of OOP Benefits Helps in modularizing code (divide into reusable blocks)

Makes the code more maintainable

Supports code reusability through inheritance

Improves security by encapsulating data

Enables real-world modeling in programs
